        <p>Easy and hard way: <p>
        <a>Easy and hard way is Ato's second stage which has simple gameplay but optional hard gameplay. The hard gameplay walkthrough is about terrifying gameplay to the jtoh difficulty chart. It only has 3 hard ways. First one is a ladder jump or something?? I don't know but the second one is definitely the hardest and it has some difficult jumps and wraps. The third one has some annoying thin studs with a wrap. The stage for sunny coins in the Summer Update and has been nerfed and the nerf has made a new possible shortcut that skips the kill brick part and jumps. The stage also used to have a sign but then erased when it was added in the game. The sign still remains with no text.<a>
