         <a>Stuff that Ato told me to add<a>
         <a>Ato is a Tower of Jelly administrator that usually make stages and other stuff not other people have done. Ato's real name is actually Tony and lives in Poland.<a>
         <a>He joined the community on really early 2022 and decided to help out the game by adding more stages and unique stuff. Once then he reached 10k coins as the first one to ever get 10k. He then shortly joined the discord server and decided to talk there oftenly.<a>
         <a>Once then Tony finally made a stage called Endless Hell. It's a secret stage that was in the game for 2 months or so and was the first stage to have an outside and signs. The gameplay is made to be extremely hard but when the stage was added the gameplay has been nerfed a bit. He then got 20k coins and looking like a god of ToJ then suddenly Peter joins in the community then shortly after 1 month or so he gone pass Ato. At the same period of time he made some stages called Easy and Hard Way that used to have a sign but then the text was erased when the stage realased ingame. But the sign still remains with no text and still left on the game.<a>
